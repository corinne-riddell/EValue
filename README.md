# Evalue calculator for sensitivty analysis in observational studies

This repo contains the R Code for an R Shiny web application that calculates the e-value. The e-value was introduced by VanderWeele and Ding in 2017 in a publication in the Annals of Internal Medicine. I created this calculate to facilitate easy e-value computation. Please open an issue or submit a pull request if you have uncovered a calculation error or would like to suggest a stylistic improvement.
